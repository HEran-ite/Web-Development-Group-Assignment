## We choose PostgreSQL for our project over other relational databases because : 
  -Structured Data with Relationships:  our hotel-booking system involves interconnections among data entities like rooms, bookings, customers, etc. PostgreSQL's relational model excels in managing structured data with well-defined relationships.
  -Reliability: It provides reliability in data storage and retrieval, ensuring that our project maintains data integrity even as it evolves. This reliability is crucial, especially when handling booking details and customer information.
